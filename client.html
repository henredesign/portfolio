      SELF LOVE IS... // ZINE PROMOTION<br>
      2022
    </h2>
    <p class="desc">
I was approached by the art collective, Self Love Social Club, to promote their upcoming zine that would highlight artists and community members that express their healing and journey to self love. 
<br><br>
My task was to create social media motion graphics that spotlighted these four individuals that embodied the following feelings: “a hug, a soft forehead kiss, a windy morning, a whisper, a sunset by the beach, a quiet solo night in, an after shower, fresh warm sheets, garden sprouting, the way your brain responses when you learn something new...etc.” In motion, the graphics slowly move in a soft wave and the gradient ripples like water. </p>

     omy gosh BY frostine // SINGLE COVER<br>
      2020
    </h2>
    <p class="desc">
The artist ‘frostine’ connected with me to design the cover of her debut single ‘omy gosh’. I was excited to work with her in creating her vision for this project. 
<br><br>
She provided this self portrait of herself with the vision of transforming it into a cover that fit into theme with her hyperpop aesthetic, with the CMYK 8bit halo and glitchy bust. We also included a handwritten title and artist name inspired by David Bowie’s ‘Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)'.

      STARTAGS // LOGO AND BUSINESS CARDS <br>

    <p class="desc">
StarTags is a new small business that creates fun custom nametags for starbucks employees. The owner connected with me to create the logo for his busniess and design his business card with this new logo.
<br><br>
I wanted to create a logo that embodied the structure of the nametags that were created in a way that fit the clints preferred color palette of black, white and green. </p>
