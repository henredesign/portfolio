      <h2>
      THE UNDERGROUND MAINSTREAM // POSTER<br>2017
    </h2>
    <p class="desc">
This poster was created as a reaction to the aticle written by Steven Heller, "The Underground Mainstream." In this article, he writes about the ways that subcultures are seen as less than until they are appropriated, commodified and assimilated into the mainstream. One example that stayed wth me during the reading was the appropriation of Barbra Krugers art by the clothing brand Supreme. This poster takes the ideas from the article and research done around this specific appropriation to critque the use of feminist art for a brand that has a history of promoting sexism within their own design in order to market to cishet men. </p>
