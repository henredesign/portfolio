      IDENTITY DISRUPTION // BOOK<br>2020
    </h2>
    <p class="desc">
To exist and identify as a disruption of systematic norms constantly puts you at risk in the world around you.
<br>
      <br> Identity Disruption is a collection of stories told by people who feel that their identity disrupts the standards set by the society that surrounds them. I had conversations with each of them and discussed how they experience the risk that their disruptive identity may put them in. Then, each of them thought of an artifact that would help them confront the risk that they face or help others in similar situations. These artifacts stem from a range of protection, pride, anger, and fear. The purpose of this is to show the ways that people of different backgrounds and experiences may face the world when they do not fit the Western standard of who and what they should be.
