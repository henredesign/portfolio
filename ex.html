      SAY ¬°EEEEE! // TABLETOP EXHIBITION<br>
      2019
    </h2>
    <p class="desc">
Say EEEEE, say AAAAA, say OOOOO! This is a concert that enforces the Fluxus ideals that all individuals should be producing art at all times with no dictation, by encouraging the observer to participate in the creation of the show. Showcasing examples of phonetic poetry, instructional design, and anti-art, the concert can only exist with the energy provided, not from the artists, but by the audience as it is viewed.
<br>
You are the performer and the content is your instrument. It's time to start the show!

<br><br><br>
Say ¬°EEEEE! is a tabletop exhibition of books compiling works from many different Fluxus artists and writers throughout the 1970's.
<br><br>
In affiliation with Chris Hamamoto's Exhibition Design course at CCA and The Letterform Archive. Designed and curated by: Alice Niu, Charles Victor, Deborah Khodanovich, Henry Rivera, and Kevin Lee.  </p>

      BANANASKINCREDITCARDSCREEN // EXHIBITION CURATION<br>
      2019
    </h2>
    <p class="desc">
BANANASKINCREDITCARDSCREEN is a collection of work created by Dutch performative design duo Tereza and Vit Ruller, known as The Rodina. 
<br><br>
In their thesis, Action to Surface, they describe three understandings of surface: 

<br><br>
the first being a natural surface ‚Äî üçå; <br>
the second is a passive surface ‚Äî üí≥; <br>
the third being more active ‚Äî üì±.<br>
<br><br>

This exhibition showcases the interpretation of these surfaces through printed material as well as digital work.

<br><br>

BANANASKINCREDITCARDSCREEN was created in affiliation with Chris Hamamoto's Exhibition Design course at CCA. Designed and curated by: Alice Niu, Charles Victor, Deborah Khodanovich, Henry Rivera, and Kevin Lee.  </p>
